The Language Metadata Table (LMT) is an expandable mapping resource that is used to organize language metadata via locations and dialects. It was created to provide a unified source of reference for language codes for use throughout the media and entertainment industries.

The LMT is a controlled vocabulary of codes from the larger IETF BCP 47 dictionary. The goal of LMT is to encourage interoperability in code usage by restricting the options to those in practical use within the industry.

The contributions to the register are delivered to SMPTE by Maintainer organizations. The SMPTE process is used to scrutinize the submissions prior to publication.
