# XML Schema Definitions

This section shall apply whenever a data structure is specified using XML schema definitions as specified in W3C XML Schema Part 1: Structures and W3C XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes.

In order to avoid duplication between text and schema, the cardinality and default values of elements are specified in the schema definitions only.

In the event of a conflict between schema definitions and the prose, the prose shall take precedence
