# JSON Schema Definitions

:::{custom-style="smpte-note"}

NOTE: [During the Public CD, the JSON Schema is still in draft form. It is expected that this document will stay
in public CD until the IETF standardisation is complete]{custom-style="smpte-ch-review-highlight"}

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The normative schema for the published data is provided as element a of this
document. The semantics and normative provisions of the schema are described in
the text of this document. Portions of the full schema are included in-line to
improve the readability of constraints.

In order to avoid duplication between text and schema, the cardinality and
default values of elements are specified in the schema definitions only.

In the event of a conflict between schema definitions and the prose in this
document, the prose shall take precedence
