The Language Metadata Table (LMT) is an controlled vocabulary that is used to
organize language metadata via locations and dialects. It was created to provide
a unified, standards based source of reference for language codes for use
throughout the media and entertainment industries.

LMT values are selected from the standardsed values in the IETF BCP 47
dictionary. The goal of LMT is to encourage interoperability in code usage by
restricting the options to those in practical use within the industry.

Users of the register might maintain versions of the SMPTE register for their
own administrative purposes. The format of the SMPTE register is intended for
direct use by implmenters.
